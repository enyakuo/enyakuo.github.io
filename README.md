<p>I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the social psychology program at Yale. My research interests broadly include intergroup relations, political psychology, and stigma-based solidarity in racially diverse contexts. I work primarily with Dr. Jennifer Richeson in the <a href="https://spcl.yale.edu/">Social Perception & Communication Lab</a> and with Dr. Michael Kraus in the <a href="https://www.csinequality.com/">Contending with Societal Inequality Lab</a>. My work is supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and the <a href="https://ritm.yale.edu/">Yale Center for the Study of Race, Indigeneity, and Transnational Migration</a>.</p>
