<p>I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the social psychology program at Yale. I am broadly interested in intergroup relations and political psychology in racially diverse contexts. I work with Dr. Jennifer Richeson in the <a href="https://spcl.yale.edu/">Social Perception & Communication Lab</a> and with Dr. Michael Kraus in the <a href="https://www.csinequality.com/">Contending with Societal Inequality Lab</a>. I earned my B.A. in psychology and political science from UCLA.</p>
